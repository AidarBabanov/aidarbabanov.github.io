As it often happens, I started actively, but at some point I just abandoned it. I don't even want to comment on the situation, it is so common.
It's like I'm preparing for an exam. The best motivator is of course the deadline. But there are no deadlines in job seeking. So let's get back to basics. The main thing is to like and not to strain. And the preparation itself began to strain. Do everything like a child, with comfort and passion.

In general, I have a post in drafts about how my first 2 weeks went. I wrote down my goals and made a plan. But it seems that I need to take the easy path in order for the path to be. Also find like-minded people to make it easier.

That's all. This is the first step on my easy path. Do not write long posts, otherwise they remain in drafts.
