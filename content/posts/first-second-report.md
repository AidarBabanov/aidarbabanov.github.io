I can summarize that I am not disciplined, low motivated and tired person. Solving problems every day is a difficult task in itself.
First, I can say that I am tired at my work. Eight hours a day, without a motivation to work makes me to procrastinate. Since I am a responsible person i am trying to compensate lost time. So, I am working too much time in a day.

### Work

This is where I'm going to change the strategy of my first job. I will plan the day with precise goals. The more words I write in the plan, the more noticeable my goals will be. I will be using a timer for planned procrastination breaks. Breaks plan: 30 mins work, 10 mins break. Also, I should have one hour for a lunch. Eight hours in the day will be spitted into alternation of work and breaks. Lunch is not included in the work and break cycle.
So, if I start working at 11 AM o'clock, I am going to end at 8 PM with lunch break in the middle. Total working time is 6 hours and 2 hours of breaks. Nice.

But, in most of the cases, external life can force you to have breaks during the working period. Someone can write or call me. I can start doing side work. Cooking also takes some time. What can I do? Nothing. I can try to compensate lost time, but in this case I have to postpone my working hours.
I am going to do next. If my side work takes less than 20 mins, then I take my working hours for this without a compensation. If it takes more time, then I have to postpone my working hours. Last rule will not to postpone more than 2 hours in a day. I don't want to work at night.

### LeetCode

I have started solving the problems.
