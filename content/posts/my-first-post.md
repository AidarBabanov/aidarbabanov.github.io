## What and why?

Probably every developer sooner or later decides that he is ready to move forward and try his luck in working for a top company.
These companies are called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). More recently, one company has changed its name.
Facebook was renamed Meta. So, technically, the acronym can be changed to MAANG.

I will not write tutorials on how to get into the top company, since there is a lot of such information on the Internet and it will be pointless to create a duplicate of such content. Rather, this blog is intended to track your progress and organize your training. I will create a plan, save resources and do weekly reports, and possibly more often.

To be honest, I have not yet felt the point of why I need to work in a top company, rather, I just want to feel the challenge in finding a job and make money at the job itself. I am in search of my meaning in life, and perhaps smart people in good companies will reveal the secret of happiness for me, and perhaps a new country and atmosphere will help me understand what is worth dreaming about. In short, it has become fashionable to look for a job in a top company.

My main preparation resource will be: [Interview School] (https://interviews.school/) from Adilet Zhaksybai. The whole path of preparation is described here with all the nuances. According to Adilet, the interview process consists of four main stages: CV submission to the company, online interviews, field interviews, and job offer discussion. Each of the stages has its own difficulties and procedures.

I want to find a job within six months. Why half a year? Probably because, this is the period of time when you can prepare very carefully and not miss anything. We give ourselves time to work at a relaxed pace. I decided that every week I would post reports on how my preparation was progressing. Thus, every week, I can keep track of the dynamics of changes.

### Stages

**Applying to the company.**

There are several actions that need to be done:

- Rewrite your resume
- Give it to experienced people for verification
- Seek new resume readers for new tips
- Search for offers

**Online interview:**

- Learn to solve problems quickly
- Learn to solve complex problems
- Learn the types of tasks you need
- Lots of practice
- Ability to explain your decision in the decision process

**Onsite interviews.**

Essentially the same as an online interview, but with a personal presence in the company. At this stage, it is important to show your soft skills. But I have yet to find out what should be at this stage of the interview.

**Discussion of the job offer.**

This part is not known to me at all. Most likely, at this stage, working conditions and wages are discussed. It is worth finding out how expensive is life in a particular country.

### Conclusion

In addition to all these things, it is worth constantly looking for new information on top companies, tips, tricks and etc. Let the game begin!
