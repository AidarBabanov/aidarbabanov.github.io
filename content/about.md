Hello, my name is Aidar. I am the ruler and humble owner of this site.

I originally wanted to run this blog as a job search blog at FAANG. Now I have decided this blog is going to be about everything that interests me. It just so happened that I'm not interested in finding a job but my health and psychological condition. Of course, I will search for a new job, but the blog will be about everything. Most likely I will be divided into categories, it will be seen.
