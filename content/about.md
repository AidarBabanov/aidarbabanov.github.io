My name is Aidar Babanov. I am Backend Golang software engineer.
This blog is my personal diary and notebook for helpful information.
I decided to start a blog because:

- I want to get into the FAANG company, and I need to systematize the preparation for the interview and the submission of documents.
- I always wanted to create my own blog and store useful information on it.
- I want to learn how to write beautifully.
