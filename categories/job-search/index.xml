Probably every developer sooner or later decides that he is ready to move forward and try his luck in working for a top company. These companies are called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). More recently, one company has changed its name. Facebook was renamed Meta. So, technically, the acronym can be changed to MAANG.
I will not write tutorials on how to get into the top company, since there is a lot of such information on the Internet and it will be pointless to create a duplicate of such content.</description></item></channel></rss>
